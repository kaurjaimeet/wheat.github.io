RNA Seq data of  <em> Triticum aestivum </em>(accession pau C273) and<em> Aegilops speltoides</em> (accession pau 3809) were used for the study. Genes involved in heat stress were identified through the transcripts inter-comparison of the <em>Aegilops speltoides</em> and <em>Triticum aestivum</em>.</p>
